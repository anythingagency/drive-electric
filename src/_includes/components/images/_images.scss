// Responsive images (ensure images don't scale beyond their parents)
//
// This is purposefully opt-in via an explicit class rather than being the default for all `<img loading="lazy">`s.
// We previously tried the "images are responsive by default" approach in Bootstrap v2,
// and abandoned it in Bootstrap v3 because it breaks lots of third-party widgets (including Google Maps)
// which weren't expecting the images within themselves to be involuntarily resized.
// See also https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/18178
.img-fluid {
  @include img-fluid;
}

// Useful for avatars/profile pics etc
.img-round {
	border-radius: 50%;
}

// Applies darkening effect to imagery
.img-darken {
  filter: brightness($image-filter-darken);
}

// Make img act like background-size: cover
.img-fill {
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
  width: 100%;

  // Where the img is nested within div .img-fill
  // Use * so it's not stipped by purge because img tag
  // is not present in html
  @include only-amp() {
    > * {
      object-fit: cover;
    }
  }
}

// Apply to a parent link in order to apply hover effect
// to image contained within
.img-link {
  @include hover-focus {
    img {
      filter: brightness($image-filter-darken);
    }
  }
}
